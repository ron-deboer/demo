            Tether tokens are referred to as stablecoins because they offer
            price stability as they are pegged to a fiat currency. This offers
            traders, merchants and funds a low volatility solution when exiting
            positions in the market. All Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with
            a matching fiat currency (e.g., 1 USD₮ = 1 USD) and are backed 100%
            by Tether’s reserves.

        <h4>More stability, more growth</h4>
        <p>
            Tether tokens have grown in popularity over the past few years, with
            a market cap of more than US$100 billion (as of March 2024). Tether
            tokens allow customers the ability to transact across different
            blockchains, without the inherent volatility and complexity
            typically associated with digital tokens.
