        <h1>What are Tether tokens and how do they work?</h1>
        <h4>
            Tether tokens are assets that move across the blockchain just as
            easily as other digital currencies but that are pegged to real-world
            currencies on a 1-to-1 basis.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Tether tokens are referred to as stablecoins because they offer
            price stability as they are pegged to a fiat currency. This offers
            traders, merchants and funds a low volatility solution when exiting
            positions in the market. All Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with
            a matching fiat currency (e.g., 1 USD₮ = 1 USD) and are backed 100%
            by Tether’s reserves.
        </p>
        <h4>More stability, more growth</h4>
        <p>
            Tether tokens have grown in popularity over the past few years, with
            a market cap of more than US$100 billion (as of March 2024). Tether
            tokens allow customers the ability to transact across different
            blockchains, without the inherent volatility and complexity
            typically associated with digital tokens.
